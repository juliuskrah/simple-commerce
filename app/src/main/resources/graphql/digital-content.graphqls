    Add media to a product. The product's media can be used to showcase the product. The following types of
    media can be added: images, videos, 3D models, and audio files.
    When uploading new media, you must first stage the upload by calling the [stagedUpload](#stagedUpload) mutation
    before calling this mutation.

    ```graphql
    mutation stageUpload($input: StagedUploadInput!) {
        stagedUpload(input: $input) {
            presignedUrl
            resourceUrl
            contentType
        }
    }
    ```

    Upload the file using `presignedUrl` and `contentType` from the [stagedUpload](#stagedUpload) mutation.
    Then use the `resourceUrl` when calling this mutation.

    addProductMedia(productId: ID!, file: FileInput!): MediaFile

    Create a presigned URL for uploading a file to a cloud storage service. This is the first
    step in the upload process.
